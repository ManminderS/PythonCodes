#Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old.



# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
age = input("What is your current age? ")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
days = 90 * 365 - int(age) * 365
Weeks = 90 * 52 - int(age) * 52
months = 90 * 12 - int(age) * 12
print(f"You have {days} days, {Weeks} weeks, {months} months left")
